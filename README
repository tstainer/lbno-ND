// Title: Near Detector Geometry Design for LAGUNA-LBNO studies
//
// Description: This is a root based geometry for an initial Near Detector design for the LAGUNA-LBNO collaboration. It consists if a High Pressure Gas Argon TPC,
//		surrounded by a thin aluminum case. This is then surrounded by a Totally Active Scintillator (TAS) of plastic, with its own enclosure.
//		Then it has an ECAL layer which consists of Scintillator / Lead layers, which are not fully surrounding as to avoid large mass upstream of the TPC and TAS.
//		A HCAL layer then follows with Scintillator / Iron layers with the same design as the ECAL, with the idea to magnetise the Iron.
//		A C-shaped magnet is also implemented but can also be ignored in the geometry.
//		A block of iron is placed behind to represent a MIND detector downstream of the ND.
//		This is all inserted into the Rock, which is assumed to be sandstone, and the detector is implanted into a cavity of 1 m surrounding the ND.
//
// All parameters that concern design can be changed within the src/NearDetector.cxx file, once this is done use make to rebuild the new design. 
// To turn a layer off, i.e remove the Magnet simply choose its size to = 0
//


Build is done via waf, in order to do this run the commands:
	1. ./waf configure
	2. ./waf build
	3. build/geometry

Then file is output into outputFiles/ND_geometry.root and the .sh script in this directory will draw the geometry. 
	4. cd outputFiles
	5. root -l drawGeometry.cxx

To remove build files run:
	./waf distclean

The Makefile is not necessary for build but can be altered to run on users local machine
